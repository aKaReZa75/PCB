> Note: If you do not see the "Open Git Bash here" option, it means that Git is not installed on your system.
> 
>  You can download and install Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
>  
>  For a tutorial on how to install and use Git, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/BsykgHpmUt8).
  
-  Once **Git Bash** is open, run the following command to clone the repository:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/aKaReZa75/PCB
```
- You can copy the above command by either:
- Clicking on the **Copy** button on the right of the command.
- Or select the command text manually and press **Ctrl + C** to copy.
- To paste the command into your **Git Bash** terminal, use **Shift + Insert**.
